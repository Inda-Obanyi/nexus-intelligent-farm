# NEXUS — MVP PRODUCT BRIEF

## Product

**NEXUS — Intelligent Farm Decision & Autonomous Management System**

NEXUS is an AI-driven farm intelligence and autonomous management platform designed to help farms move from fragmented observations and manual decisions toward a continuous decision-and-execution loop.

## Core Product Loop

## Core Problem

Farm operations require repeated decisions across planting, watering, harvesting, resource allocation, risk management, timing, and operational execution.

These decisions are often disconnected:

- farm state is observed separately from planning;
- predictions do not always become operational decisions;
- decisions are not always connected to execution;
- execution outcomes are rarely converted into structured historical evidence;
- historical experience is difficult to reuse systematically.

NEXUS is designed to close this loop.

## What Makes NEXUS Different

NEXUS is not positioned as only a crop-prediction model.

Its architecture connects:

```text
Farm State
    +
Risk / Prediction Intelligence
    ↓
Decision Engine
    ↓
Execution Intent
    ↓
Spatial Planning
    ↓
Environment Action
    ↓
Outcome Evaluation
    ↓
Experience Memory
    ↓
Historical Evidence
```

This creates a pathway toward an adaptive farm operating system rather than an isolated prediction tool.

## Current MVP

The current MVP is validated inside the Kaggriculture simulation environment.

The system can:

- construct farm state;
- evaluate structured crop risks;
- generate and score candidate decisions;
- select strategic actions;
- create persistent spatial execution intents;
- select execution targets;
- navigate toward targets;
- execute actions;
- evaluate outcomes;
- construct and store historical experiences;
- retrieve contextually similar experiences;
- summarize historical evidence;
- interpret historical outcome patterns.

Historical evidence currently remains descriptive and does not modify the live decision score.

## Validated MVP Results

A reproducible 720-step episode using seed 101 produced:

| Metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| Steps requested | 720 |
| Decisions recorded | 719 |
| Experiences recorded | 719 |
| MATCHED | 374 |
| PARTIAL | 318 |
| NOT_MATCHED | 10 |
| UNKNOWN | 0 |
| Harvest decisions | 249 |
| Successful harvests | 82 |
| Verified target crops | 82 |
| Matched harvests | 82 |
| Harvested units | 82 |
| Records interpreted | 409 |
| Records with historical retrieval | 403 |

Automated regression baseline:

**103 tests passed**

## Decision Safety / Architectural Boundary

A runtime invariance probe was performed with an intentionally extreme historical experience carrying a decision score of 999999.0.

The current decision remained unchanged:

```text
Decision: PLANT_WHEAT
Action:   ['PLANT', 'WHEAT']
Score:    8.0
```

Result:

```text
Decision unchanged: PASS
Action unchanged:   PASS
History retrieved:  PASS
OVERALL:             PASS
```

This confirms that the current historical-intelligence layer is descriptive rather than a hidden policy modifier.

## Autonomous Harvest Validation

NEXUS supports persistent spatial execution intents for operations such as harvesting.

During the validated 720-step episode:

```text
Harvest decisions:      249
Successful harvests:     82
Verified target crops:   82
Matched harvests:        82
Harvested units:         82
```

A successful harvest requires actual target-level evidence:

- the intended target crop existed;
- the target crop was removed;
- harvested product was recorded;
- harvested units increased.

Movement toward a target is not incorrectly classified as a successful harvest.

## Target Users

Initial target users include:

1. Small and medium-scale farmers.
2. Commercial farms.
3. Agricultural extension and farm-management organisations.
4. Agri-tech operators managing multiple farms.
5. Agricultural research and innovation programmes.

## Initial Nigerian Use Case

NEXUS is intended for Nigerian farming environments where fragmented information, limited technical support, operational uncertainty, and resource constraints make timely farm decisions difficult.

The long-term opportunity is to combine:

- local farm observations;
- weather intelligence;
- crop risk;
- market intelligence;
- farm resources;
- historical farm experiences;
- operational planning.

## Long-Term Product

The MVP is the foundation for a broader farm intelligence platform:

```text
Farm Data
   +
External Intelligence
   +
Historical Experience
        ↓
Decision Intelligence
        ↓
Farm Recommendations
        ↓
Operational Automation
```

Future interfaces may include dashboards, mobile workflows, SMS/USSD integrations, WhatsApp workflows, and integrations with field sensors and farm-management systems.

## Commercialisation Direction

Potential future business models include:

- subscription software for farms;
- farm-management SaaS;
- enterprise deployment for agricultural organisations;
- agricultural intelligence services;
- API and integration services;
- institutional deployments.

The exact commercial model will be validated during real-farm pilots rather than assumed from the simulation MVP.

## Current Product Stage

NEXUS should be described accurately as:

**A simulation-validated technical MVP with a working autonomous decision-and-execution loop and structured historical intelligence.**

The MVP does not yet claim:

- commercial-scale deployment;
- large-scale user traction;
- production agronomic recommendations;
- autonomous physical robotics;
- revenue validation;
- a learned reinforcement-learning policy.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — MVP

Validated simulation-based autonomous decision and execution loop.

### Phase 2 — Real-Farm Validation

Connect NEXUS to structured observations from real farms and validate:

- state representation;
- recommendations;
- operational feasibility;
- farmer feedback;
- outcome tracking.

### Phase 3 — Evidence-Informed Decisions

Develop stronger recommendations from historical evidence while maintaining explicit policy boundaries and auditability.

### Phase 4 — Adaptive Farm Intelligence

Investigate adaptive policies using validated historical outcomes and farm-specific context.

### Phase 5 — Autonomous Farm Operations

Extend toward external farm integrations, field systems, sensors, and operational automation.
